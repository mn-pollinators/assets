        "how_many_are_there": " In the US and Canada there are about 50 species of Bombus bees.",
        "taking_care_of_the_brood": "Nests are started in the spring by gynes (inseminated females) that have mated with males at the end of summer or early autumn the previous season. For about two weeks, gynes forage on flowers after mating to build fat stores until they find an overwintering site. In early spring the gynes emerge to forage and search for a nesting site. Once gynes find a suitable nest, they create a wax nectar pot to store nectar. Wax is secreted from galds between the abdominal segments on the bottom of their abdomen. When it is too cold to forage, the nectar pots provides food for the bees. The colony continues to grow in numbers and size as the season progresses and as more workers are produced to forage and rear offspring within the nest. In order to produce male bees, the queen lays unfertilized eggs starting in June or July. She also lays fertilized eggs producing gynes that are fed more pollen than workers. Gynes become the queen next growing season. Like other native bees, once the males leave the nest as adults, they do not return to the nest or help with any provisioning duties. Their role is to mate with the gynes produced from other colonies. After mating, the males perish within a few weeks; the new gynes, however, overwinter, establishing a colony the following spring. The queen and her workers in the nest also perish after a hard frost.",
        "common_forage_plants": "Because bumble bees form an annual social colony with bees active throughout the growing season, the plants they forage on and collect provisions from vary widely. When bumble bees are out foraging for provisions, they often demonstrate floral constancy: foraging from one flower to the next of the same plant species. This behavior makes them very effective pollinators as they move pollen from flower to flower of the same species, ultimately contributing to the cross-pollination of plants.

Males often have larger eyes and are longer in length than females; slender hind legs that lack pollen baskets; long hair on clypeus that hangs over mandibles.",
        "did_you_know": "Bumble bees can forage for both pollen and nectar in cool temperatures; they warm their body by vibrating their flight muscles, the same muscles used in buzz pollination. Bumble bees have a number of physiological traits that allow them to collect or forage for provisions on a wide range of flower forms. These include: long tongues, a large size, the ability to sonicate (buzz-pollinate) flowers, and abundant hairs for cooler weather. Bumble bees play a vital role in the pollination of many agricultural crops such as apples, cherries, plums, currants, gooseberries, tomatoes, eggplants, blueberries, and cranberries. Many of these crops require sonication to extract pollen from the flowers. This means that a bumble bee carries more pollen from flower to flower and it increases the probability of successful pollination and fruit set. Sonicating bees can also visit more flowers in a shorter time than other bees.",
