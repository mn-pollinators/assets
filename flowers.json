Common milkweed attracts lots of kinds of insects both to feed on the nectar from the flowers and to lay eggs. This is an important plant to the monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus. The monarch butterfly lays its eggs on the leaves, and when the eggs hatch, the larvae eat the leaves before turning into butterflies. Common milkweed commonly attracts these bees: Megachile (leafcutter bees), Bombus (bumble bees), Halictus (sweat bees), and Coelioxys (cuckoo bees)."

It is considered a weed in most places but it is sometimes used as a medical herb and in food preparation. Common Dandelion can be found growing in temperate regions of the world, in lawns, on roadsides, on disturbed banks and shores of water ways, and other areas with moist soils. Common dandelion is well known for its yellow flower heads that turn into round balls of silver tufted fruits that disperse in the wind. The common name comes from the French “dent de lion”—tooth of lion—referring to the sharp leaf lobes. Common Dandelion attracts an extremely large range of pollinators but only in times of extreme need (the quality of the pollen is low). Common Dandelion attracts these bees: Colletes (cellophane bees), Hylaeus (yellow-faced bees), Andrena (mining bees), Calliopsis (mining bees), Agapostemon (metallic green sweat bees), Halictus (sweat bees), Lasioglossum (small sweat bees), Augochloropsis and Augochlorella and Augochlora (metallic green sweat bees), Osmia (mason bees), Megachile (leafcutter bees), Hoplitis (mason bees), Heriades (small resin bees), Anthidium (wool carder bees), Bombus (bumble bees), Anthophora (digger bees), Melissodes (long-horned bees), Ceratina (small carpenter bees), and Xylocopa (large carpenter bees)."
