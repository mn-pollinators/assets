# Minnesota Pollinators Assets

This repository contains a variety of assets for projects related to Minnesota pollinators and native plants.
This project is part of a [grant-funded project](https://wcroc.cfans.umn.edu/restoring-native-prairie) to restore native prairie on a site in Morris, MN
and help people learn about pollinators and the native prairie plants that support them.
